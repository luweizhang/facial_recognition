#Facial recognition chrome extension

Here is a simple chrome extension that runs facial recognition algorithms on your linkedin profile pic.  

Just navigate to anyone's profile page and click the button on the top right to "deploy the algorithm."  You will then immediately receive extremely useful info about that person's age, gender, and race!
